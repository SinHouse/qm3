\subsection[dcd]{dcd.py}
The class \func{dcd} provides
minimal methods for reading and writing XPLOR-based trajectory files (DCD). The main variables are
the number of atoms (\func{N}); and the coordinates (\func{X}, \func{Y} and \func{Z}), which should
be modified previous to an \func{append} call. The \func{read} and \func{write} methods are intended
only for initialisation, and \func{next} / \func{append} will perform the reading / writing sutff.
The final number of frames in the trajectory is set after a \func{close} call.\\
The final number of frames stored in the trajectory is set after calling \func{close}.
