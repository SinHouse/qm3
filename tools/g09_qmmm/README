Formally the charge on the link atom should be incorporated into the QM counterpart,
but taking into account the charge of the MM atom which has been substituted by hydrogen...

Try centering the system before mk_input.py (for Pilgrim for example) using:

	coor orie mass noro sele segi A show end


MM counterparts of the link atoms should not be included in the MM selection...
(since they will be passed as charges into gaussian calculations)
